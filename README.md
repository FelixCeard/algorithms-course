This repo uses `uv` to run everything, it's like pip but more powerful (everyone has the SAME python version and packages, so it's easier to reproduce results).

To run a program, you simply run `uv run program.py`. You can add a package to the virtual environment with `uv add package`. The virtual environment is used by default, you don't have to do anything.
